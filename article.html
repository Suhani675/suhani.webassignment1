      <h2>Understanding CSS Animations</h2>
      <p>CSS animations allow you to animate HTML elements seamlessly by specifying keyframes of the animation's progression. To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.

        Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.</p>
      
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>What is a Keyframe?</h2>
        <p>Keyframes gives you more control over the animation you want to perform. The animation is created by gradually changing from one style to another. You can change the CSS styles as many times as you want.</p>

      <h2>Creating Common Animation Effects</h2>
      <h3>Fade In/Fade Out</h3>
      <p>In CSS, "fade in" and "fade out" refer to visual effects where an element gradually appears (fades in) or disappears (fades out) on the screen, rather than abruptly appearing or disappearing. These effects are often used to create smoother transitions between different states of an element or to draw attention to certain parts of a webpage in a more subtle way.Here's a code snippet for it:</p>
      <pre><code>@keyframes fadeIn {
  0% { opacity: 0; }
  100% { opacity: 1; }
}

.element {
  animation-name: fadeIn;
  animation-duration: 1s;
}</code></pre><a href="fadeIn.html"><b>TRY YOURSELF</b></a>
      <h3>Slide In</h3>
      <p>In CSS, "slide in" and "slide out" refer to visual effects where an element moves into view (slides in) or moves out of view (slides out) on the screen, rather than appearing or disappearing instantly. These effects are often used to create dynamic transitions between different parts of a webpage or to animate the appearance and disappearance of elements in a more engaging way. Here's a code snippet for it: </p>
      <pre><code>@keyframes slideIn {
        0% { transform: translateX(-100%); }
        100% { transform: translateX(0); }
      }
      
      .element {
        animation-name: slideIn;
        animation-duration: 1s;
      }
      </code></pre><a href="slidein.html"><b>TRY YOURSELF</b></a>
      <h3>Spin</h3>
      <p>The spin animation is designed to make an element rotate continuously.  Here's a code snippet for it: </p>
      <pre><code>.spin {
        animation: spin 2s linear infinite;
    }
    
    @keyframes spin {
        from { transform: rotate(0deg); }
        to { transform: rotate(360deg); }
    }
    </code></pre><a href="spin.html"><b>TRY YOURSELF</b></a>
    <h3>Color Change Animation:</h3>
    <p>The color change animation gradually transitions the background color of an element from one color to another. Here's a code snippet for it:  </p>
    <pre><code>.color-change {
      animation: changeColor 2s infinite alternate;
  }
  
  @keyframes changeColor {
      from { background-color: red; }
      to { background-color: blue; }
  }</code></pre><a href="changecolor.html"><b>TRY YOURSELF</b></a>
